First time set-up.
Make sure you have anaconda for python.
Open anaconda prompt.
To create a new environment: "conda create -n chatbot python=3.6"
To start the new environment: "conda activate chatbot"
To install numpy and tensorflow packages: "conda install numpy", "conda install tensorflow"
To install the tflearn package, go to the website https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn and download a copy in a zip form. Extract the files 
in the zip file. Delete the outer folder. Move the tflearn-master folder into the Chatbot folder. Then inside the anaconda prompt type: 
"cd\Users\edmun\OneDrive\Desktop\Chatbot\tflearn-master" to navigate to that folder directory. Then type: "setup.py install"
To install nltk package: "conda install nltk", "python", "import nltk", "nltk.download()"
When the pop-up appears, select all at the very top and click download (it will take a long time, approximately 15 minutes)
*******************************************************************************************************************************************
Every time you wish to customise the responses of the chatbot, open intents.json with notepad and change it.
The "tag" is a category which the user input falls under, such as a greeting or goodbye.
The "patterns" are the possible user inputs, and the "responses" are the appropriate replies to the user input.
The good thing is that the user input does not have to match exactly, the intents are not hard-coded, the program will figure it out.
If the user input is too incomprehensible, the program will return a message asking for another question instead of giving a reply which 
doesn't make sense.

After updating, remember to retrain it. Delete the data.pickle file and uncomment the line "model = tflearn.DNN(net)" before running 
main.py again. This will update the changes you've made to the intents.json file. After running main.py once, remember to re-comment the
line "model = tflearn.DNN(net)" in main.py again.
